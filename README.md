### Well met! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a masters degree in Financial Mathematics at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. I already have a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics + Industrial Engineering and Management at the same university. 

Even though I'm pursuing a degree in Financial Mathematics I also have a big interest in Data Analytics and Data Science, more specifically in Machine Learning. This is reflected in the repos you can find under my handle. Here is a selection of the projects I'm most proud of!

### ‚ùì[Blackbox Feasibility Prediction](https://github.com/KodAgge/Feasibility-Prediction)‚ùì

Working together with a fintech firm and three classmates we looked into the possibility of using Machine Learning to speed up their operations. The team within the firm we were working with had one main task: solving a constrained non-linear optimization problem using an evolutionary optimization algorithm called CMA-ES. However, there was one problem, deciding upon the feasibility of the solutions the algorithm suggested was computationally heavy. Our task was thus to see if Machine Learning could be used to filter out infeasible solutions. We took an explorative approach, testing a wide range of Machine Learning algorithms, supervised as well as unsupervised. Unfortunetaly, not method yielded useful results. We thinks this is mainly due to the evolutionary algorithm advancing towards the optimum in iterational steps through the large feature space (~4000 dimensions), which means that the classifiers needs to extrapolate.

_Below follows a gif of how the CMA-ES moves during its first 100 iteration, projected down to 3 dimensions using PCA_

### ‚úçÔ∏è[Handwritten Mathematical Expressions to LaTeX](https://github.com/KodAgge/Img2Latex)‚úçÔ∏è
As part of the final project in a Deep Learning course at KTH me and three classmates got the idea to of building a model that translates handwritten mathemtical expressions directly to LaTeX-code. This could save us a lot of time since manually entering equations into LaTeX is a very tedious task.

Looking into previous research we found that an Encoder-Decoder model consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network would be most promising for our task. We thus constructed an Encoder consisting of a CNN with batch normalization and max-pooling and a Decoder consisting of a LSTM with a soft attention mechanism. For better performance beam search was used during prediction.

While the results weren't super promising for longer expressions the model performed well on some expression I wrote myself. Here are some examples!

### [Re-Implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://github.com/Javigsv/LDA_AdML)

In the final project of a course in Advanced Machine Learning the task was to replicate the results of a famous paper within Machine Learning. Me and three classmates chose the 
[(2003) Blei et. al. paper Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://github.com/Javigsv/LDA_AdML/blob/main/LDA%20paper.pdf) which introduced the LDA model; a model that was created for topic modelling in large corpora in order to find low-dimensional representations of documents while retaining statistical relationships useful for tasks relating to information retrieval.

Due to the model being intractible one needs to use some kind of approximation technique. We thus used an Variational Inference - Expectation Maximization (VI-EM) alogrithm.

We also looked at possibilites to extend upon the original paper. One thing we achieved was plotting topics' popularity over time. Below follows such a plot for three topics.
