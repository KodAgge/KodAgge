### Well met! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a masters degree in Financial Mathematics at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. I already have a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics + Industrial Engineering and Management at the same university. 

Even though I'm pursuing a degree in Financial Mathematics I also have a big interest in Data Analytics and Data Science, more specifically in Machine Learning. This is reflected in the repos you can find under my handle. Here is a selection of the projects I'm most proud of!

### ‚ùì[Blackbox Feasibility Prediction](https://github.com/KodAgge/Feasibility-Prediction)

Working together with a fintech firm and three classmates we looked into the possibility of using Machine Learning to speed up their operations. The team within the firm we were working with had one main task: solving a constrained non-linear optimization problem using an evolutionary optimization algorithm called CMA-ES. However, there was one problem, deciding upon the feasibility of the solutions the algorithm suggested was computationally heavy. Our task was thus to see if Machine Learning could be used to filter out infeasible solutions. We took an explorative approach, testing a wide range of Machine Learning algorithms, supervised as well as unsupervised. Unfortunetaly, not method yielded useful results. We thinks this is mainly due to the evolutionary algorithm advancing towards the optimum in iterational steps through the large feature space (~4000 dimensions), which means that the classifiers needs to extrapolate.
